## üîß **Codebase Integration**

### **Analyzing Existing Code**

When you include `--codebase`, Marvin analyzes your existing code structure:

```bash
marvin process new-feature.md --codebase ./src/ --output ./tasks/
```

**What Marvin Analyzes:**
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture patterns** (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- üìÅ **File structure** and organization
- üîå **Frameworks and libraries** in use
- üóÉÔ∏è **Database models** and schemas
- üõ†Ô∏è **API patterns** and conventions
- üß™ **Testing approaches** and frameworks

### **Enhanced Task Generation**

With codebase analysis, tasks become more specific:

```xml title="Without codebase analysis"
<requirement>Create user authentication API</requirement>
```

```xml title="With codebase analysis"
<requirement>
  Extend existing FastAPI auth module at src/auth/
  following the established JWT pattern used in 
  src/auth/models.py and src/auth/routes.py
</requirement>
```

### **Architecture Alignment**

Marvin ensures new tasks fit your existing architecture:

!!! example "Django Project Detection"
    ```xml
    <implementation_notes>
      <note>Use Django models extending AbstractUser</note>
      <note>Follow existing serializer patterns in api/serializers/</note>
      <note>Add tests to tests/test_auth.py following pytest conventions</note>
      <note>Use Django REST framework viewsets for consistency</note>
    </implementation_notes>
    ```

!!! example "React Project Detection"
    ```xml
    <implementation_notes>
      <note>Create components in src/components/ following existing structure</note>
      <note>Use existing Redux store pattern for state management</note>
      <note>Follow TypeScript interfaces defined in src/types/</note>
      <note>Add tests using existing Jest + React Testing Library setup</note>
    </implementation_notes>
    ```

## üìà **Optimization Tips**

### **Better Requirements = Better Tasks**

=== "‚ùå Vague Requirements"
    ```markdown
    ## Requirements
    - Users should be able to interact with content
    - The system should be fast
    - Make it secure
    ```
    
    **Result:** Generic, non-actionable tasks

=== "‚úÖ Specific Requirements"
    ```markdown
    ## Requirements
    - Users can like posts with real-time counter updates
    - Feed loads in < 2 seconds for 1000+ posts
    - All API endpoints require JWT authentication
    - Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute per user
    ```
    
    **Result:** Detailed, implementation-ready tasks

### **Include Context and Constraints**

```markdown
## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing PostgreSQL database
- Frontend uses React 18+ with TypeScript
- Backend API follows OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility
- Performance budget: < 200ms API response time

## Business Constraints  
- Feature must launch before Q2 deadline
- Budget allows for 40 development hours
- Must support 10,000 concurrent users
- Compliance with GDPR requirements
```

### **Effective User Stories**

```markdown
## User Stories

### Primary Users (End Customers)
- As a shopper, I want to save items for later so I can purchase them when ready
- As a return customer, I want my cart to persist across devices
- As a mobile user, I want the cart to work seamlessly on my phone

### Secondary Users (Business Stakeholders)
- As a product manager, I need cart abandonment analytics
- As a marketing team member, I want to send cart reminder emails
- As a customer service rep, I need to view customer cart contents

### System Stories (Technical)
- As the system, I need to sync cart data across user sessions
- As the database, I need efficient queries for cart retrieval
- As the API, I need to handle concurrent cart modifications
```

## üö® **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Poor Task Generation**

??? question "Tasks are too generic"
    **Problem:** PRD lacks specific details
    
    **Solution:**
    - Add technical constraints and requirements
    - Include specific metrics and performance criteria
    - Provide examples of desired behavior
    - Specify integration points with existing systems

??? question "Missing dependencies"
    **Problem:** Tasks seem disconnected
    
    **Solution:**
    - Use `--codebase` flag to analyze existing code
    - Include system architecture in PRD
    - Specify data flow and component interactions
    - Add integration requirements

??? question "Wrong technology assumptions"
    **Problem:** Tasks suggest wrong frameworks
    
    **Solution:**
    - Include current tech stack in PRD
    - Use `--codebase` analysis
    - Add technical constraints section
    - Specify required tools and frameworks

### **Processing Errors**

??? question "Unable to parse PRD"
    **Problem:** File format or encoding issues
    
    **Solution:**
    ```bash
    # Check file encoding
    file social-feed.md
    
    # Convert if needed
    iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 input.md > output.md
    
    # Use verbose mode for debugging
    marvin process input.md --verbose
    ```

??? question "Empty or minimal output"
    **Problem:** PRD doesn't contain enough structured information
    
    **Solution:**
    - Ensure PRD has clear headings and sections
    - Add more detailed requirements
    - Include acceptance criteria
    - Use markdown formatting for better parsing

- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include specific, measurable requirements
- Add technical constraints and performance criteria
