# Writing Effective PRDs for Marvin

## üéØ The Foundation of AI-Powered Development

A well-written PRD is the difference between AI generating mediocre code and production-ready solutions. This guide teaches you how to write PRDs that unlock the full potential of AI coding assistants.

## The PRD Transformation

| PRD Quality | AI Output Quality | Development Time | Bug Rate |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|----------|

```

## üîë Key Principles for Effective PRDs

### 1. Be Specific, Not Vague

```markdown
‚ùå "Good error handling"

‚úÖ "Return HTTP 400 for validation errors with field-level details:
{
  'errors': {
    'email': 'Invalid email format',
    'password': 'Must be at least 12 characters'
  }
}"
```

### 2. Include Edge Cases

```markdown
## Edge Cases to Handle

### Concurrent Editing
- When two users edit the same message simultaneously
- Resolution: Last write wins with conflict notification
- Both versions saved in edit history

### Network Interruption  
- Message sending interrupted mid-flight
- Resolution: Client-side retry with idempotency key
- Duplicate prevention on server side

### Storage Quota Exceeded
- User attempts upload beyond quota
- Resolution: Clear error message with upgrade option
- Graceful degradation for essential features
```

### 3. Define Integration Points

```markdown
## External Integrations

### Authentication
- SAML 2.0 for enterprise SSO
- OAuth2 for Google Workspace
- LDAP/AD sync for user provisioning
- SCIM protocol for user lifecycle

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- OpenTelemetry tracing
- Structured logs to Elasticsearch
- Error reporting to Sentry

### Compliance
- SIEM integration via syslog
- DLP tool webhooks
- Audit log streaming to Splunk
```

### 4. Specify Data Models

```markdown
## Data Architecture

### User Model
- id: UUID (primary key)
- email: string (unique, encrypted)
- name: string (encrypted) 
- role: enum (admin, user, guest)
- mfa_enabled: boolean
- last_login: timestamp
- created_at: timestamp
- organization_id: UUID (foreign key)

### Message Model  
- id: UUID (primary key)
- content: text (encrypted)
- author_id: UUID (foreign key)
- channel_id: UUID (foreign key)
- thread_id: UUID (nullable)
- edited: boolean
- deleted: boolean
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp

### Indexes
- messages.channel_id, created_at (compound)
- messages.author_id
- users.email (unique)
- users.organization_id
```

**Wrong**: "Add payment processing"  
**Right**: "Stripe integration for payments, requiring PCI compliance, webhook handling, and reconciliation system"

### 3. Vague Performance Requirements
**Wrong**: "Should be fast"  
**Right**: "Page load < 2s, API response < 200ms (p95), support 1000 concurrent users"

### 4. Incomplete Error Handling
**Wrong**: "Handle errors appropriately"
