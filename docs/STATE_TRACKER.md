## 🎯 Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

1. **Complete DocumentAnalysisAgent**
   - Implement the `_analyze_markdown` method properly
   - Add support for extracting all PRD sections
   - Create proper Feature objects with dependencies

2. **Implement XMLGenerator**
   - Use the provided template structure
   - Create proper XML building logic
   - Add validation against the template schema

3. **Wire up the agents**
   - Connect DocumentAnalysisAgent to prd_analysis_agent
   - Implement actual tool functions instead of placeholders
   - Add proper state management between agents

4. **Create basic tests**
   - Unit tests for domain models
   - Integration tests for agent workflows
   - End-to-end test for PRD → Template conversion

5. **Update logging**
   - Replace print statements with Loguru
   - Add structured logging throughout
   - Implement log levels and formatting

## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **Agent Implementation**: Current agents are mostly placeholders
2. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling strategy
3. **State Management**: No persistent state between runs
4. **Configuration**: Hard-coded values need configuration system
5. **Testing**: Minimal test coverage currently

## 📝 Notes

- The project has a solid foundation with well-designed domain models
- ADK integration has started but needs significant work
- The CLI and API structure is good but needs real implementation
- The provided XML template is comprehensive and should be used as-is
- Focus should be on getting a working MVP before adding advanced features

## 🚦 Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: ADK integration complexity may cause delays
- **Medium Risk**: NLP-based feature extraction accuracy
- **Low Risk**: Basic file I/O and XML generation
- **Mitigation**: Start with rule-based extraction before full NLP
