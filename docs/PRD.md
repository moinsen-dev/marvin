# Product Requirements Document: Marvin

> Version 1.0 | 2025-05-08

## 1. Overview

Marvin is an intelligent tool for converting Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into structured AI-Coding-Tasks. Named after the paranoid-depressive robot from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," Marvin helps developers organize their projects and effectively use AI coding assistants (like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code).

## 2. Product Vision

Marvin enables developers to maximize the power of AI coding assistants by providing a structured method to break down complex software requirements into well-formed task sequences. These tasks are provided in an XML format that can be optimally processed by AI assistants.

## 3. Target Audience

- Software developers working with AI coding assistants
- Project managers who want to convert requirements into actionable tasks
- Teams seeking a structured approach for incremental product development

## 4. Solution Approach

Marvin uses an agent-based approach with four core components:

1. **PRD Analysis**: Extraction of features and requirements from unstructured documents
2. **Codebase Scanning**: Understanding existing projects for seamless feature integration
3. **Task Template Generation**: Creation of XML-based templates for AI coding assistants
4. **Sequence Planning**: Optimal arrangement of tasks based on dependencies

## 5. System Architecture

Marvin uses a Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) with:

- **Core Domain**: Business logic and domain models
- **Adapters**: Various access methods (CLI, API, MCP server)
- **Infrastructure**: Technical implementations for parsers, analyzers, etc.
- **Agents**: Specialized AI components for various tasks

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 PRD Analysis

- **PRD-01**: Marvin can read and analyze text-based PRDs (Markdown, Docs, PDF)
- **PRD-02**: Marvin extracts features, requirements, and dependencies from PRDs
- **PRD-03**: Marvin recognizes priorities and effort estimates, if present

### 6.2 Codebase Scanning

- **CBS-01**: Marvin can scan and understand existing codebases
- **CBS-02**: Marvin identifies architecture patterns and components
- **CBS-03**: Marvin recognizes technologies, frameworks, and libraries used
- **CBS-04**: Marvin can analyze code dependencies

### 6.3 Template Generation

- **TPL-01**: Marvin creates XML-based task templates according to specifications
- **TPL-02**: Marvin automatically fills templates with relevant information from PRD and codebase
- **TPL-03**: Marvin generates descriptive TaskIDs and unique sequence numbers

### 6.4 Sequence Planning

- **SEQ-01**: Marvin plans optimal implementation sequences based on dependencies
- **SEQ-02**: Marvin recognizes and resolves conflicts between dependent tasks
- **SEQ-03**: Marvin allows manual adjustment of sequences

### 6.5 Interfaces

- **INT-01**: Marvin provides a CLI for local use by developers
- **INT-02**: Marvin provides a REST API for integrations
- **INT-03**: Marvin provides an MCP server for collaborative use

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Performance

- **PERF-01**: Analysis of a PRD with 20 features < 30 seconds
- **PERF-02**: Codebase scanning < 1 minute per 10,000 LOC

### 7.2 Scalability

- **SCAL-01**: Support for PRDs with up to 100 features
- **SCAL-02**: Support for codebases with up to 500,000 LOC

### 7.3 Security

- **SEC-01**: No unencrypted data in external storage
- **SEC-02**: API authentication with JWT
- **SEC-03**: Rate limiting for all endpoints

### 7.4 Usability

- **USE-01**: Intuitive CLI commands with meaningful help texts
- **USE-02**: Detailed progress indicators for lengthy operations
- **USE-03**: Structured and understandable error messages

## 8. Technology and Integration Requirements

### 8.1 AI Integration

- **AI-01**: Integration with Google ADK for agent implementation
- **AI-02**: Use of Context 7 for deep code understanding
- **AI-03**: Possibility of offline use with local LLMs

### 8.2 DevOps Integration

- **DEV-01**: Deployment as Docker container
- **DEV-02**: CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing and deployment
- **DEV-03**: API endpoints for common CI/CD systems

## 9. Project Planning

### 9.1 MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

Phase 1:
- Basic project structure
- Implement domain models
- Simple PRD analysis with Regex/NLP
- Basic template generation
- CLI interface

Phase 2:
- Integration with Context 7
- Improved PRD parser with LLM
- Implement sequence planner
- Simple API with FastAPI

### 9.2 Full Version

## 10. Assumptions and Limitations

- Marvin requires Python 3.11 or higher
- An internet connection is recommended for optimal results
- Local LLM usage significantly increases hardware requirements

## 11. Glossary

- **PRD**: Product Requirements Document
- **ADK**: Agent Development Kit (Google)
- **MCP**: Master Control Program (server for collaborative use)
- **LLM**: Large Language Model
- **Task**: A single, clearly defined development task
