## üìÑ **Step 2: Create Your First PRD**

Let's start with a real-world example. Create a file called `social-feed.md`:

```markdown title="social-feed.md"
# Social Media Feed Feature

## Product Overview
We need to build a social media feed that allows users to post updates, 
like content, and comment on posts in real-time.

## Core Requirements

### User Posts

- Posts have timestamps and author information
- Users can edit their own posts within 5 minutes

### Engagement Features  
- Like/unlike posts with real-time counter updates
- Comment on posts with threaded replies
- Share posts with other users
- Real-time notifications for interactions

### Feed Display
- Chronological feed of posts from followed users
- Infinite scroll pagination
- Real-time updates when new posts are available
- Filter options (all posts, friends only, trending)

## Technical Requirements
- RESTful API backend
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Mobile-responsive design
- Database optimization for fast feed generation
- Content moderation hooks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can create and edit posts

## ‚ö° **Step 3: Transform with Marvin**

Now let's see Marvin in action:

```bash
# Process the PRD
marvin process social-feed.md --output ./tasks/

# Check what was generated
ls -la ./tasks/
```

**Expected Output:**
```
./tasks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_001_user_posts_data_model.xml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_002_user_posts_api_endpoints.xml  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_003_post_creation_ui.xml

    ```bash
    # Copy the task content
    cat tasks/task_001_user_posts_data_model.xml
    
    # Paste into Cursor with this prompt:
    # "Implement this task following the specifications exactly"
    ```

=== "Windsurf"
    ```bash
    # Open the task file in Windsurf
    windsurf tasks/task_001_user_posts_data_model.xml
    
    # Use the task content as your AI prompt
    ```

=== "Claude Code"
    ```bash
    # Share the task with Claude Code:
    # "Please implement the following coding task: [paste XML content]"
    ```

### üéØ **Pro Tips for AI Integration**

!!! tip "Get Better AI Results"
    
    **Perfect Prompt Formula:**
    ```
    Please implement this coding task following the XML specification exactly:
    
    [Paste the entire XML task here]
    
    Additional context:
    - Use [your preferred framework/language]
    - Follow [your coding standards]
    - Include comprehensive tests
    ```

!!! success "Why This Works So Well"
    
    - **Structured Context**: AI gets all the information it needs
    - **Clear Requirements**: No ambiguity about what to build
    - **Dependency Awareness**: AI understands what needs to exist first
    - **Testing Strategy**: AI can write tests alongside code
    - **Implementation Notes**: AI follows best practices automatically

## üìà **Step 6: See the Results**

Here's what you can expect when using Marvin-generated tasks with AI:

### ‚ùå **Before Marvin (Typical AI Prompt)**
```
"Build a social media feed with posts, likes, and comments"
```

**AI Output:** Generic code, missing edge cases, no tests, unclear structure

### ‚úÖ **After Marvin (Structured Task)**
```xml
<coding_task>
  <title>User Posts Data Model Implementation</title>
  <requirements>
    <requirement>Post model with text content (280 char limit)</requirement>
    <!-- ... detailed specifications ... -->
  </requirements>
</coding_task>
```

**AI Output:** Production-ready code, comprehensive tests, proper validation, optimized queries!

## ‚ùì **Having Issues?**

<div class="troubleshooting" markdown>

### Common Problems

??? question "Tasks seem too generic"
    **Solution:** Add more detail to your PRD. Include specific technical requirements, constraints, and examples.

??? question "Dependencies are unclear"
    **Solution:** Use `marvin process --codebase ./src` to analyze your existing code structure.

??? question "AI doesn't understand the context"
